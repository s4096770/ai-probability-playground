# 📊 Probabilistic Risk Assessment Engine

A professional-grade interactive dashboard for modelling uncertainty in random processes and evaluating basic cyber risk scenarios using probabilistic simulation.

This project demonstrates real-world analytical thinking, risk modelling principles, and practical data visualisation techniques commonly used in cybersecurity, risk analysis, and decision science roles.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Probabilistic Risk Assessment Engine is an interactive system built to simulate, analyse, and visualise:

* Random event outcomes (coin flips & dice rolls)
* Cyber threat likelihood under varying defensive conditions

It allows users to explore how probability behaves in practice and how risk changes as system parameters evolve.

This is designed to feel like an analyst tool — not a classroom demo.

## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### 🎲 Random Event Simulation

Model stochastic behaviour across large trial runs:

* Coin flip outcome distribution
* Dice roll probability convergence
* Theoretical vs observed probability comparison
* Real-time graphical plotting

### 🛡️ Threat Risk Assessment

Simulate cyber attack success probability based on:

* Base attack likelihood
* Defensive strength level
* Scenario volume

Outputs include:

* Adjusted risk metrics
* Visual risk indicators

## 👤 Author

Built as a passion-driven project exploring uncertainty, probability, and how risk behaves in dynamic systems. This work reflects a deep interest in turning abstractical concepts into interactive, meaningful tools that help people understand how decisions, chance, and protection mechanisms interact in the real world.

This engine is designed to evolve — incorporating richer models, stronger simulations, and more expressive visualisations as the system grows.
